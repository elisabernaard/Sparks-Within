# Sparks Within

Set in another dimension, you drift as a disembodied consciousness, navigating this realm by tuning into others — beings whose presence you can hear when you gaze at them. As you listen, you are invited to gather their unique sounds. Each collected sound allows you to move through an evolving environment. As you travel from entity to entity, the sounds stay with you, forming a personal symphony — a melody of the universe. Silence turns to resonance, and the shifting world around you settles into harmony — a place of calm, shaped by your presence.
